I did not really have too much time to make this, I have a pretty strict schedule atm.
Please keep in mind I am not good at design ;)

Also I have not really used Tailwind that much, if you look at my project's code then you should see some places where it is better applied than other places. This is because I slowly descovered ways of using it that makde it easier to make the same design or similar designs.


## Things I would want to make better if I had more time

1. Error handling on if there is no more questions left.
2. I would have loved to make some modals. For when you just login prompting you to click start a game maybe to choose which dificulty you are wanting to play on.
3. Was planning on making toasts on some actions.
4. Styling of nav bar, the nav bar is a bit meh, I did not do much to it since I felt it was not really a big part of the assignment, adding a bruger menu might help a bit but it seems to be fine without one, since it scales okay.
5. Figure out a way to get rid of the hash tags in the url. It seems that if you do not use the hash mode then it will simply not work on reloading it will return a 404 on github pages.
