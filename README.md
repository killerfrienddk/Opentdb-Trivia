I didn't have a lot of time to work on this project, as I have a very strict schedule at the moment. Please keep in mind that I am not skilled in design. Additionally, I haven't used Tailwind much, so you may notice some places in the code where it is applied better than others. This is because I gradually learned how to use it more effectively as I worked on the project.

### If I had more time, there are a few things I would like to improve:

Add error handling for when there are no more questions left.
Implement modals, such as one that appears when you log in, asking you to start a game or select a difficulty level.
Add toasts for certain actions.
Enhance the styling of the nav bar. While it's not a major focus of the project, adding a user menu could make it look better. However, it's currently sufficient as it scales well.
Implement measures to prevent users from accessing the results page and seeing all of the results.
Create a tooltip script using a directive.
Develop more custom components.
Find a way to remove hash tags from the URL. Currently, if the hash mode is not used, the page will not work when reloaded and will return a 404 error on GitHub Pages.
